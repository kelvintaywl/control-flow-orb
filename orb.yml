  approve-workflow:
    description: |
      Looks for and approve an approval job in a specific workflow in this current pipeline.
      Useful for forcing workflow XYZ to run only after workflow ABC.
      Assumes the approval job is at the start of workflow XYZ in this case.
      See the `sequential-workflow` example for more information.

      NOTE: this requires a valid CircleCI API token, and assumes this is available via the $CIRCLE_TOKEN environment variable.
    parameters:
      workflow-name:
        type: string
        description: |
          Name of the workflow to look up against.
          Assumes the workflow name is unique.
          Otherwise, it will look up the first workflow in this pipeline that matches this name.
      job-name:
        type: string
        description: |
          Name of the approval job in workflow to approve.
          Assumes the job name is unique.
          Otherwise, it will look up the first approval job in the workflow that matches this name.

examples:
  sequential-workflow:
    description: |
      Uses control-flow/approve-workflow job, an approval job to control the order between 2 workflows.

      In this example, we want to run workflow bbb only after aaa.
      We add an approval job (start) as the first job for workflow bbb.
      We then add the control-flow/approve-workflow job as the final job in workflow aaa.

      Essentially, workflow bbb is on-hold until workflow aaa approves the approval job in workflow bbb.
